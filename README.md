## Project Description

This repository provides a simple simulation of a distributed system **(DS)** focusing on the **modeling of input/output (I/O) operations** for stock management. The goal is not to build a real stock management system, but rather to demonstrate how system components **(represented by Docker containers)** communicate and **exchange** messages in a distributed environment.

The project uses Java to handle the communication between containers, simulating the process of sending and receiving messages, and Docker to isolate and manage the different nodes of the system. This model helps to visualize and understand the flow of messages within a distributed system and how nodes interact in such an environment.

### Key Features:

- Simple simulation of distributed system communication
- Java for simulating message exchange (send/receive)
- Docker containers representing system nodes and components
- Visualization of message flow in a distributed system




> This <b>project</b> serves as a foundational demonstration of distributed systems concepts using modern tools like Docker and Java for communication and modeling.
